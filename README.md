ERMS Reimbursement Project

Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to develop a full-stack Java application for a reimbursement system that allows users to submit tickets for reimbursement and have them approved of rejected by a manager. This ticket includes fields such as price and description which the user can populate before submitting. The user can also view all of their pending tickets as well as their tickets that have been approved or denied by the manager. The application also provides functionality for the manager, who can view the tickets for all employees, view tickets for specific employees, view pending tickets, view accepted tickets, and view denied tickets. The manager also has the ability to deny and accept submitted tickets as well as manually delete tickets from the database. This application uses Java and Spring Boot for the back-end component and TypeScript with React for the front-end portion. This data is also stored in the PostgreSQL database.
